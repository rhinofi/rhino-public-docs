title: 'Authentication'

Most API endpoints require you to authenticate your requests using a Json Web Token (JWT). You can obtain a JWT by making a `POST` request to https://api.rhino.fi/authentication/auth/apiKey and including your API key in the payload.

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
curl https://api.rhino.fi/authentication/auth/apiKey \
  -d '{"apiKey": "YOUR_API_KEY"}'\
  -H 'content-type: application/json'
```
```javascript JavaScript
const response = await fetch('https://api.rhino.fi/authentication/auth/apiKey', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'content-type': 'application/json',
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY',
  }),
})
const { jwt } = await response.json()
```
</CodeGroup>

## Using the JWT

Once you have a JWT, you need to include it in your API requests using the `Authorization` header. Example:

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
curl https://api.rhino.fi -H 'Authorization: YOUR_JWT'
```
```javascript JavaScript
fetch('https://api.rhino.fi', {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'YOUR_JWT',
  },
})
```
</CodeGroup>

**A JWT obtained from an API key is only valid for one hour.** Once expired, you can just use your API key again in the same way to obtain a fresh JWT.

<Note>
We recommend using the SDK if you use JavaScript/TypeScript for your application as it will take care of handling the JWT flow for you.
