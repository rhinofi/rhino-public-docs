## Authentication

All non-public API endpoints are authenticated using a bearer token. To authenticate your requests, include the token in the `Authorization` header.

The authentication token can be obtained by reaching out to us. We'll provide you with a unique API key that you can use to access our API.

Use the form below to get in touch with us:

<RequestApiKey />

Alternatively, you can authenticate via an EVM compatible wallet by signing a message with your private key.
