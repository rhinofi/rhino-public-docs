title: TON
---

To create a chain adapter for TON you will need to pass a [TonConnectUI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tonconnect/ui) instance.

```typescript
import { getTonChainAdapter } from '@rhino.fi/sdk/adapters/ton'

const chainAdapter = getTonChainAdapter(
  tonConnectUI,
  chainConfig,
  rpcUrl
)
```

<Warning>
As there are no stable public TON RPC endpoints, you will need to provide your own.
