You can either create a Solana chain adapter from an [Anchor](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@coral-xyz/anchor) `Wallet` instance or as a shortcut from a Solana secret key:

### From wallet

Use this method to use connected wallets in webapps or if you want to set up a wallet yourself.

```typescript
import { getSolanaChainAdapterFromWallet } from '@rhino.fi/sdk/adapters/solana'

// You can initialize the wallet yourself or depending on the specific browser
// wallet find it in th global window object
const chainAdapter = getSolanaChainAdapterFromWallet(
  wallet,
  chainConfig,
  rpcUrl,
)
```

### From secret key

Use this method as a shortcut to setting up a wallet yourself.

```typescript
import { getSolanaChainAdapterFromSecretKey } from '@rhino.fi/sdk/adapters/solana'

const chainAdapter = getSolanaChainAdapterFromSecretKey(
  'YOUR_SECRET_KEY',
  chainConfig
  rpcUrl,
)
```

<Warning>
As there are no stable public Solana RPC endpoints, you will need to provide your own.
