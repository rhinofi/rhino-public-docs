## General usage

Each chain adapter has a different way of constructing it, as each chain uses different libraries. However, one parameter all included chain adapters have in common is the config of the chain from the Rhino API. The included [bridge functions](/sdk/bridge-functions) will handle fetching the correct chain config for you. If you wan to construct a chain adapter ahead of time, you will need to [fetch the chain config](/sdk/concepts#bridge-and-chain-configs) manually before.

## Included chain adapters:

- [EVM chains](/sdk/chain-adapters/evm-chains)
- [Paradex](/sdk/chain-adapters/paradex)
- [Solana](/sdk/chain-adapters/solana)
- [Starknet](/sdk/chain-adapters/starknet)
- [TON](/sdk/chain-adapters/ton)
- [Tron](/sdk/chain-adapters/tron)
