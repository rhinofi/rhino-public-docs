title: EVM chains
---

Since all EVM chains can use the same tooling and libraries, you can use the same chain adapter for all of them. You can create one either from a EIP-1193 compatible provider or as a shortcut from a private key.

<CodeGroup>
```typescript From provider
import { getEvmChainAdapterFromProvider } from '@rhino.fi/sdk/adapters/evm'

const chainAdapter = getEvmChainAdapterFromProvider(
  provider,
  chainConfig
)
```
```typescript From private key
import { getEvmChainAdapterFromPrivateKey } from '@rhino.fi/sdk/adapters/evm'

const chainAdapter = getEvmChainAdapterFromPrivateKey(
  'YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY',
  chainConfig
)
```
</CodeGroup>

### Options

Both functions also accept a 3rd options parameter. Currently it only includes a `tokenAllowanceOverride` property that allows you to specify a higher token allowance to be used instead of the calculated one. This can be useful to optimize gas usage by setting bigger allowances that will last for multiple bridges.
