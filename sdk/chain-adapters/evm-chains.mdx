title: EVM chains
---

Since all EVM chains can use the same tooling and libraries, you can use the same chain adapter function for all of them. You can create one either from a EIP-1193 compatible provider or as a shortcut from a private key.

### From EIP-1193 provider

Use this method to use connected wallets in webapps or if you want to set up a provider yourself.

```typescript
import { getEvmChainAdapterFromProvider } from '@rhino.fi/sdk/adapters/evm'

const chainAdapter = getEvmChainAdapterFromProvider(
  provider,
  chainConfig
)
```

### From private key

Use this method as a shortcut to setting up a provider yourself.

```typescript
import { getEvmChainAdapterFromPrivateKey } from '@rhino.fi/sdk/adapters/evm'

const chainAdapter = getEvmChainAdapterFromPrivateKey(
  'YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY',
  chainConfig
)
```

### Options

Both functions also accept a 3rd options parameter. Currently it only includes a `tokenAllowanceOverride` property that allows you to specify a higher token allowance to be used instead of the calculated one. This can be useful to optimize gas usage by setting bigger allowances that will last for multiple bridges.

## Fetching EVM balances

Normally you would use the `getAllBalances` function on a chain adapter to fetch all balances of an address on a chain. However as the same address is can hold assets on any EVM chain, it would be very cumbersome to create a chain adapter for each EVM chain and query it's balances.  
To make this easier, the the SDK provides a shortcut function to fetch all balances on all supported EVM chains by only providing the [bridge config](/sdk/concepts#bridge-and-chain-configs) and a wallet address. You can use it like this:

```typescript
import { getAllEvmBalances } from '@rhino.fi/sdk/adapters/evm'

const balances = await getAllEvmBalances(bridgeConfig, 'WALLET_ADDRESS')

console.log(balances)
```

The result will look like this:

```typescript
{
  ETHEREUM: {
    USDT: {
      tokenConfig: {...},
      balance: 10550000n,
      balanceWithDecimals; 10.55,
      balanceFormatted: '10.55',
    },
    USDC: {...},
  },
  BASE: {...}
}
```
