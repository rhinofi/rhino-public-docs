<Info>
  The `commitmentId` required by the contract corresponds to the `quoteId` returned by the API.

  To obtain the `commitmentId`, first request a quote from the API, then commit it. The response will include the `quoteId`, which should be used as the `commitmentId` in the contract call.

  See [the API bridge example](/api/bridge#6-full-example) for details.
