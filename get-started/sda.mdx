title: "Smart Deposit Addresses"
description: "Smart Deposit Addresses (SDAs) are a flexible way to simplify onboarding flows, reconcile deposits, and abstract cross-chain complexity. Instead of asking users to navigate bridges or swap flows themselves, you give them a simple deposit address. The system takes care of the rest."

See some live use cases here: [5 ways to use SDAs](https://rhino.fi/blog/5-ways-to-use-smart-deposit-addresses)

## The Flow

At a high level, the process works as follows:

1. **Generate an SDA**: Call the API to create a new deposit address, linked to a destination chain and address or a target action (coming soon).
2. **User deposits**: Any wallet, CEX, or payment service can send supported tokens to the SDA. The user only performs a normal token transfer.
3. **Monitoring & orchestration**: The system continuously watches for incoming transfers. If a valid deposit arrives (correct token, within limits), it triggers the bridge process.
4. **Cross-chain execution**: Funds are credited on the destination chain, or the requested post-bridge action (e.g. swap, pool deposit) is performed.
5. **Reconciliation & sweeping**: After crediting is complete, addresses are swept periodically to consolidate balances and keep monitoring efficient.

From the client/user perspective: user sends → destination credited → job done.

## The Features

Key properties that make SDAs flexible:

- **Many-to-one**: Multiple SDAs can funnel to the same destination address.
- **Multi-chain source support**: SDAs can currently be generated on Ethereum, Arbitrum, Base, BSC, Polygon, Optimism, Kaia, Tron, with Solana in progress.
- **Any-chain destination**: Funds can settle on any of the 35+ Rhino-supported chains, including non-EVMs (Starknet, Ton, Solana, etc.).
- **Stablecoin primitives**:
  - Same-to-same (e.g. USDC → USDC)
  - Cross-stable swap (e.g. USDC → USDT)
- **Programmable actions**: Trigger post-bridge actions like swaps, pool deposits, or contract interactions.
- **Metadata support**: Attach arbitrary data (e.g. UUID) to track users, payments, or invoices.
- **Flexible fees**: Either end-user pays or client covers on their behalf. Volume-based plus destination gas.
- **Validity: **unlimited
- **Deposit size**: Typically 5-digit USD+ supported, 7-digit on request.
- **Compliance built-in**: All deposits are screened for KYT/AML before crediting. Clients never touch illicit funds.
- **Privacy benefit**: SDAs are naturally decoupled from destination addresses.

Coming soon:

- **Refund address** – Users/clients can specify fallback if a credit fails (\< 1% of cases).
- **Webhooks** – Real-time push updates on deposit results.

## The Constraints

There are some limitations to be aware of:

- Only tokens are supported, no native gas coins such as ETH or MATIC.
- Wrong tokens will not be credited and require a manual refund.
- Deposits below or above set limits will not process and require a manual refund.
- If liquidity is insufficient, deposits will retry until successful or refunded.
- Fees can be fetched in real time through the API or fixed by agreement.

### Core Technologies

Several technologies come together to make Smart Deposit Addresses (SDAs) work in practice:

- **API / SDK (SDA generation)**: Developers generate deposit addresses via Rhino’s API or SDK with zero blockchain complexity. No private key management or contract deployment is required.
- **Wallet & App Transfers (funding SDA)**: Any wallet, CEX, or app that supports token transfers can send funds to an SDA. This keeps the user interaction primitive and universal.
- **Rhino Solver & Liquidity Layer (orchestration & crediting)**: Our solver system monitors deposits in real time and uses Rhino’s liquidity to credit the specified destination chain/address.
- **Reconciliation (sweeping)**: On EVM chains we use **EIP-7702**; for non-EVMs we maintain custom implementations. This ensures SDA balances are reconciled safely after crediting.

## Before You Start

- You’ll need an account in the [Rhino developer dashboard](https://developers.rhino.fi/).
- Developer accounts must be whitelisted to generate and monitor SDAs. [Contact us to be whitelisted.](https://rhino.fi/contact)
- The [API docs](/api-integration/smart-deposits) are the source of truth for supported chains, tokens, and endpoints.
