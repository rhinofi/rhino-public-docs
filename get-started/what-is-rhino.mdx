title: What is rhino.fi?
---
Rhino.fi is a decentralized finance platform that enables users to move their funds between blockchains and L2s, accessing diverse DeFi opportunities seamlessly.

To facilitate this cross-chain functionality, rhino.fi employs a system based on collateralized bridges and liquidity outpostsâ€”pools of tokens established on various chains from their own funds.

This approach allows users to deposit funds on one chain and receive equivalent tokens on another, all managed via smart contracts and processed through our API. This design ensures quick and efficient transactions.
