title: Contract examples
description: "This section provides integration examples for interacting with the rhino.fi bridge smart contracts across different blockchain environments. Whether you're working with **EVM-based chains** like Ethereum and Scroll or **non-EVM chains** such as Solana, Tron, TON, and Starknet, you'll find practical code samples to help you execute bridge transactions."
---

Select your target blockchain to explore contract interaction examples:

- [EVM Chains](./evm) – Ethereum, Scroll, and compatible chains
- [Solana](./solana)
- [Tron](./tron)
- [TON](./ton)
- [Starknet](./starknet)

If you prefer reading code locally or want to run these examples in your local environment, you can use the [Github examples repo](https://github.com/rhinofi/bridge-examples)

<Note>
We recommend using the [SDK](/sdk/quickstart) to make bridges as it has all the blockchain interactions already built in.
