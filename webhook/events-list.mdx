## Bridge events

The following bridge events will be sent to your webhook servers.

The bridge events data structure is the same as the [Bridge Status endpoint](https://docs.rhino.fi/api-reference/history/bridge-status) excluding the `state` field, use the `_tag` for the event type.

- **BRIDGE_PENDING** - sent when the bridge quote is committed
- **BRIDGE_ACCEPTED** - sent when the deposit transaction was received and validated
- **BRIDGE_EXECUTED** - sent when the bridge is completed and received on the destination chain
- **BRIDGE_REFUNDED** - when a swap is involved, the bridge might get refunded if the token price moved too much since the quote was emitted

## Smart Deposit Addresses events

### **DEPOSIT_ADDRESS_CREATED**

When a new Smart Deposit Address is generated, the `DEPOSIT_ADDRESS_CREATED` event will be sent.

Event structure:
```
{
  _tag: "DEPOSIT_ADDRESS_CREATED",
  depositChain: string
  depositAddress: string
  destinationChain: string
  destinationAddress: string
  tokenOut?: string
  postBridgeData?: PostBridgeData
  addressNote?: string
}
```

### **BRIDGE_\***

The same `BRIDGE_PENDING`, `BRIDGE_ACCEPTED` and `BRIDGE_EXECUTED` events as described above will be sent for Smart Deposit Addresses.


### **DEPOSIT_ADDRESS_BRIDGE_REJECTED**

When a Smart Deposit Address bridge is rejected, the `DEPOSIT_ADDRESS_BRIDGE_REJECTED` event will be sent.

Event structure:
```
{
  _tag: "DEPOSIT_ADDRESS_BRIDGE_REJECTED",
  _id: string, // bridge ID
  tokenSymbol: string
  tokenAddress: string
  amount: string

### **DEPOSIT_ADDRESS_BRIDGE_DELAYED**

  _id: string, // bridge ID
  tokenSymbol: string
  tokenAddress: string
  amount: string
  amountUsd: string
