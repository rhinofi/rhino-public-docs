title: 'Verify signature'
---

As your endpoint is public, anyone can send it some data. For you to make sure the data is coming from Rhino.fi, you'll receive a signature in the request header, called `rhino_signature`.

To verify the signature you have 2 options:
* Using the SDK
* Manual verification

### SDK
To verify the signature received using the SDK, you can do the following:

```typescript
const isValid = await sdk.api.webhook.verifySignature(receivedEventBody, signature)
```

Under the hood it will fetch the Rhino.fi webhook public key and verify the data provided was signed by Rhino.fi.

### Manual verification
Manually verifying the received signature is a two step process.
You first need to fetch Rhino.fi webhook public key and then use it to verify the signature.
This can be done with the following function:

```typescript
import { createHash, createVerify } from 'crypto'

const isSignatureValid = async (receivedEventBody, signature) => {
  // Fetch Rhino.fi webhook public key
  const res = await fetch('https://api.rhino.fi/webhook/public-key')
  const publicKeyBase64 = await res.json()
  const publicKey = Buffer.from(publicKeyBase64, 'base64').toString()  

  // Hash the stringified event
  const hash = createHash('sha256')
  const hashedMessage = hash.update(
    JSON.stringify(receivedEventBody),
  )

  // Verify the signature
  const verify = createVerify('RSA-SHA256')
  verify.update(hashedMessage.digest('hex'))
  return verify.verify(publicKey, signature, 'hex') 
}
```
