title: 'Get missed events'
---

If your webhook server goes down for a while and you need to fetch the events that occurred during the down time you can use the following endpoint:
```
GET https://api.rhino.fi/webhook/user-events
```

The endpoint is authenticated and it takes a few query parameters:
- `sinceTimestamp`: you'll receive all the events that happened after this timestamp
- `page`: the result is paginated so you can specify the page number
- `limit`: how many events you want to receive per page (max 50)
