Rhino offers an API that you can use to integrate the bridge into your application.  
You can use the API with any programming language you like. However, if you use JavaScript/TypeScript we recommend using our [SDK](/sdk/quickstart) as that will allow you to get started much faster.

## Useful resources

- [API Reference](/api-reference/introduction) for details on the API endpoints and request/response formats.
- [Swagger schema](https://api.rhino.fi/bridge/swagger.json) if you would like to generate client code for your preferred language.
